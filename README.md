# Move-it

This project was developed during *Next Level Week #4*, an educational program hosted by **@rocketseat**.

## About it

Working as a developer (or any occupation that requires sitting for long hours), is accomplishing, but also requires focus. Sitting in front of a computer with eyes focused on a single source of light and muscles fixed in a single position can be harmful.
So, the idea of this project is to create a tool to remember us to exercise, both eyes and body. Also, we can do it in the best way possible: gaming! 
Gain XP and level up by completing challenges. Allow yourself a rest of your work and keep yourself healthy.
